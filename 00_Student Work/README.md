===============================

Grading Rubric - 100 Points
---------------------------
(20 pts each)
- **Code Quality** (20pts): Is the code legibile, clear, and commented?
- **Technical Implementation** (20 pts): Does the work demonstrate an understanding of the technical material, including code proficiency, quality and  management, as well as an understanding of data flow, order of operations, and programming logic?
- **User Experience** (20pts): What is the quality of the experience for a person who visits the web page, specifically the usability, design, and intent?
- **Creativity** (20pts): Is there evidence of creative input, personal expression, meaningful direction, and overall thoughtfulness?
- **Documentation** (20pts): Is there a clear description of the project, any major creative and technical decisions, primary influences and inspiration, key challenges and solutions, overall lessons learned, and relevant references and resources?

Assignment #1 - Due Class 10 (Thursday 10/05)
--------------------------------------------
Create a single web page experience that, upon user input, responds with data from at least 2 web apis. One possible approach to this assignment would be to design the experience around answering a question for the user. An example of this is [doineedanumbrella.com](http://doineedanumbrella.com/). An example of a mashup that pulls together data from two different apis is the InstaTimes example provided here in the class repo. Ultimately, it's up to you what you want to build. But **(1)** a user needs to "trigger" an event, **(2)** data needs to be requested via AJAX from two APIs, and **(3)** the page should update appropriately. Your completed assignment should include a .html file, a .css file, and a .js file.

Assignment #2 - Due Class 18 (Thursday 11/09)
---------------------------------------------
Create a single web page experience that leverages data from at least one public api and incorporates the use of at least one "interaction" library (i.e. D3, p5, Three, etc.) The application should demonstrate an understanding of the library of choosing as well as an attempt to leverage the library for original creative expression.

Final Project - Due Class 28 (Thursday 12/14)
---------------------------------------------
Your final project will require creating a single web page experience that combines (1) data from at least one public web API and (2) data submitted by users that is stored in your own database. Your final project should be uploaded to the web before class and should incorporate the following elements:  
* a public web API as a data source
* a client-side js library other than jQuery and/or Underscore
* server-side code (i.e. Node-Express)
* data-storage (i.e. CouchDB on Cloudant)
* at least one route that returns stored data to the page in json format  

In terms of 'data-storage', the idea is that a user will somehow contribute (i.e. input data) to your application. User input can come in many forms including but not limited to requests, comments, reviews, links, media, feedback, high scores, solutions and more. The data input could be intended only for a specific user through a personal link or it could affect the entire experience of the application for all users. It is up to you to decide! 

Overall, the application should demonstrate an attention towards and understanding of technical topics, creative approaches, and usability patterns covered over the entire semester.
