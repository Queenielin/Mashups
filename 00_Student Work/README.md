Mashups: Student Work
===============================

Grading Rubric - 100 Points
---------------------------
(20 pts each)
- **Technical Competency** (20pts): Correct implementation of code and fulfillment of technical aspect of the assignment. Proper order of operations, data flow, and use of logic. 
- **Technical Insight** (20 pts): No redundancy or unnecessary duplication of code. Clear and easy to follow structure. Robustness and appropriate handling of invalid inputs, data responses, and edge cases. Intelligent debugging (or logging) messages.
- **User Experience** (20pts): The quality of the experience for a person who visits the web page, specifically the usability, design, and intent.
- **Creativity** (20pts): Evidence of creative input, personal expression, meaningful direction, and overall thoughtfulness.
- **Documentation** (20pts): Clear description of the project, creative and technical decisions, influences and inspiration, key challenges and solutions, overall lessons learned, and relevant references and resources. Code well organized and meaningfully commented. Variables, functions, classes, and objects have meaningful names. Unused variables, functions, or commented-out code explained.

Assignment #1 - Due Class 10 (Thursday 10/04)
--------------------------------------------
Create a single web page experience that, upon user input, responds with data from at least 2 web apis. One possible approach to this assignment would be to design the experience around answering a question for the user. An example of a mashup that pulls together data from two different apis is the FlickrTimes example provided here in the class repo. Ultimately, it's up to you what you want to build. But **(1)** a user needs to "trigger" an event, **(2)** data needs to be requested via AJAX from two APIs, and **(3)** the page should update appropriately. Your completed assignment should include a .html file, a .css file, and a .js file.

Assignment #2 - Due Class 18 (Thursday 11/09)
---------------------------------------------
Create a single web page experience that utilizes data from either a public api or a queryable static data set (or both) and that incorporates the use of at least one "interaction" library (i.e. D3, p5, Three, etc.) The application should demonstrate an understanding of the library of choosing as well as an attempt to leverage the library for original, creative and meaningful expression.

Final Project - Due Class 28 (Thursday 12/14)
---------------------------------------------
Your final project will require creating a single web page experience that combines (1) data from at least one public web API and/or a static data set and (2) data submitted by users that is stored in your own database. Your final project should be uploaded to the web before class and should incorporate the following elements:  
* a public web API or a static data set as a data source  
* a client-side js library other than jQuery and/or Underscore  
* server-side code (i.e. Node-Express)  
* data-storage (i.e. CouchDB on Cloudant)  
* at least one CORS enabled route that returns stored data to the page in json format  
* documentation for both the project and the open web API  

In terms of 'data-storage', the idea is that a user will contribute (i.e. input data) to your application. User input can come in many forms including but not limited to requests, comments, reviews, links, media, feedback, high scores, solutions and more. The data input could be intended only for a specific user through a personal link or it could affect the entire experience of the application for all users. It is up to you to decide! 

Overall, the application should demonstrate an attention towards and understanding of technical topics, creative approaches, and usability patterns covered over the entire semester.
