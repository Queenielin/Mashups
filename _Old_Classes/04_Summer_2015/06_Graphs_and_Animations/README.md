##### V. Discussion - Project #2 Due Class 8 (Monday 06/22)
* Create a single web page experience that leverages data from at least one public api and incorporates the use of at least one "interaction" library (i.e. D3, p5, Popcorn, etc.). The project must be deployed on the world wide web. 

##### VI. Homework
* Coding + Design Exercise - using any js library of your choosing, create a page that applies your own "instagram filter" to an image. This involves populating an image on the page and then manipulating the color of the image pixels. You are welcome to pull in images or add images locally, it's up to you. The goal is to show the image in it's normal state and then in it's filtered state. (Hint: using the canvas tag is a good idea!)
* Explore the [Web Audio API](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webaudio/intro/)
* Explore the [PopcornJS](http://popcornjs.org/) Video Library
* Explore the [threeJS](http://threejs.org/) library
* Think & Post - idea(s) for Assignment #2, this should include at minimum a paragraph description of what you're thinking about doing, how the data flow might work, which js library (or libraries) you want to work with, and what the experience of a user visiting the site would be like. Be prepared to present your idea(s) in class.
